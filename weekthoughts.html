		<h2>Thought of the week: ending 02/01/2026</h2>
		<p>
			This week reinforced an important truth: once the structure is sound, progress accelerates.
			By focusing on clean architecture, secure integrations, and intentional deployment decisions, I was able to move from isolated features to a cohesive, production-ready system. 
			The real win wasn’t just getting things to work it is understanding why they work, where they belong, and how to adapt when environments change.

			Each obstacle uncovered a deeper layer of learning, turning challenges into confidence and momentum. This is the kind of growth that compounds.

		<h2>Development Reflections</h2>
		<p>
			Building My Portfolio From Scratch: What I Learned Along the Way!

			When I set out to rebuild my portfolio, my goal wasn’t just to make something that looked good it was to create something that worked.
			Something that reflected how I think as a developer, and demonstrated real-world problems and problem solving.
			I chose to build everything incrementally, starting with core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and layering in features as I went. 
			This included authentication demos, RESTful API integrations, responsive layouts, animations, and eventually light React experimentation. 
			Every feature I added came with tradeoffs, bugs, and learning moments and that was intentional.
		</p>

		<h2>Fundamentals First</h2>
			<p>
				One deliberate choice I made was to focus on fundamentals before frameworks. 
				Rather than jumping immediately into heavy tooling, I wanted to be comfortable manipulating the <strong>DOM</strong>, debugging <strong>JavaScript</strong> errors, 
				managing <strong>state</strong> manually, and understanding how <strong>CSS</strong> behaves across screen sizes.

				This paid off quickly. When issues arose, whether it was a missing nav link or it not behaving correctly or a script failing due to load order I wasn’t guessing. 
				I could trace the problem, inspect it in dev tools, and fix it with confidence.
			</p>
	</section>
		<h2>Real Features, Real Feedback</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most rewarding moments in this process came after pushing a set of real features live to GitHub Pages. 
				Shortly after, I noticed a spike in traffic and repository activity including clones.

				That was an important signal.

				It told me that people weren’t just looking, they are interested enough to pull the code, explore it locally, and see how things were built. 
				That feedback reinforced the idea that substance matters. Clean structure, readable code, and practical features go a long way.
			</p>
	<section class="coming-soon">
		<h2>Debugging is Part of the Job</h2>
			<p>
				This project also reinforced something I already knew but experienced firsthand again: debugging is development.

				From resolving JavaScript reference errors, to fixing CSS conflicts in responsive layouts, to handling browser caching issues on GitHub Pages. 
				Each challenge sharpened my understanding even more of how modern web applications actually behave in production environments.
				Rather than treating bugs as setbacks, I treated them as checkpoints.
			</p>
	</section>
		<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
			<p>
				This portfolio is not “finished” and that’s by design. It’s a living project that reflects how I learn, adapt, and improve over time. 
				Going forward, I plan to continue refining features, expanding documentation, and experimenting thoughtfully with new tools while keeping a strong foundation underneath everything I build.

				If there’s one takeaway from this process, it’s this: clear thinking, solid fundamentals, and steady iteration matter more than chasing trends.
