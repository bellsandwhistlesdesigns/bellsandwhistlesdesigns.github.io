		<h2>Who I am</h2>
		<p>
			I am a full stack developer focused on building modern, API-driven
			web and application experiences. My development work spans frontend UI, 
			RESTful APIs, authentication and registration systems, and data-driven features, looking for work.

			Building My Portfolio From Scratch: What I Learned Along the Way!

			When I set out to rebuild my portfolio, my goal wasn’t just to make something that looked good — it was to create something that worked.
			Something that reflected how I think as a developer, and demonstrated real-world problem solving.
			I chose to build everything incrementally, starting with core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and layering in features as I went. 
			This included authentication demos, RESTful API integrations, responsive layouts, animations, and eventually light React experimentation. 
			Every feature I added came with tradeoffs, bugs, and learning moments — and that was intentional.
		</p>
		
		<section class="coming-soon">
		<h2>Fundamentals First</h2>
			<p>
				One deliberate choice I made was to focus on fundamentals before frameworks. 
				Rather than jumping immediately into heavy tooling, I wanted to be comfortable manipulating the DOM, debugging JavaScript errors, 
				managing state manually, and understanding how CSS behaves across screen sizes.

				This paid off quickly. When issues arose, whether it was a mobile navigation menu not behaving correctly or a script failing due to load order I wasn’t guessing. 
				I could trace the problem, inspect it in dev tools, and fix it with confidence.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Real Features, Real Feedback</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most rewarding moments in this process came after pushing a set of real features live to GitHub Pages. 
				Shortly after, I noticed a spike in traffic and repository activity including clones.

				That was an important signal.

				It told me that people weren’t just looking, they are interested enough to pull the code, explore it locally, and see how things were built. 
				That feedback reinforced the idea that substance matters. Clean structure, readable code, and practical features go a long way.
			</p>
		<section class="coming-soon">
		<h2>Debugging is Part of the Job</h2>
			<p>
				This project also reinforced something I already knew but experienced firsthand again: debugging is development.

				From resolving JavaScript reference errors, to fixing CSS conflicts in responsive layouts, to handling browser caching issues on GitHub Pages. 
				Each challenge sharpened my understanding of how modern web applications actually behave in production environments.
				Rather than treating bugs as setbacks, I treated them as checkpoints.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
			<p>
				This portfolio is not “finished” and that’s by design. It’s a living project that reflects how I learn, adapt, and improve over time. 
				Going forward, I plan to continue refining features, expanding documentation, and experimenting thoughtfully with new tools while keeping a strong foundation underneath everything I build.

				If there’s one takeaway from this process, it’s this: clear thinking, solid fundamentals, and steady iteration matter more than chasing trends.
