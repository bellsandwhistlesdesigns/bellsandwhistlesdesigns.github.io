# Bells and Whistles Designs

Official personal portfolio site created by **Douglas Moth**  
Welcome! This repository hosts my interactive portfolio showcasing real-world web development projects, full-stack readiness, and thoughtful UX design. It demonstrates my ability to build user-centered web applications, integrate third-party APIs, and deploy production-ready solutions.

## What This Project Is:

This site serves as a living portfolio and technical playground where I design, build, and refine real-world web application features.

The site highlights both frontend execution and backend architecture concepts, including secure serverless API integration, with a focus on clarity, usability, and maintainable code.

## Recent Update - 02/04/2026

Live RESTful API Demo

Serverless credits reached!

Current Status: Capped at 300 build credits
I hit the 300 build credit limit on my serverless account in just 4 days! 
Maxing out credits = proof of an active, dynamic workflow! 
Progress is real!

## Recent Update - 02/01/2026

Live RESTful API Demo

My portfolio now features a live news API integration via Netlify serverless functions, demonstrating:

- Consumption of third-party APIs (Currents News API)
- Secure storage of API keys using environment variables
- Dynamic data rendering with responsive, mobile-first design
- Graceful handling when viewed on static hosts like GitHub Pages

On GitHub Pages, the live API is replaced with a friendly message, ensuring no broken experience or exposed API keys.

## Quality & Accessibility

This site was audited using Chrome Lighthouse:

- Core pages scored 100 in accessibility
- Dashboard views maintain 95+ due to intentional color contrast tradeoffs
- Best Practices audits scored 100 across evaluated pages

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

- Frontend architecture and state-driven JavaScript
- Dynamic CRUD workflows with safe cancel and edit flows
- Responsive and accessible design using HTML5 and CSS3
- Thoughtful UI/UX decisions, including interactive feedback and user-centered workflows
