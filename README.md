## What This Project Represents:

The project reflects real-world implementation of responsive design, state-driven JavaScript, serverless integration, and thoughtful UX refinement.

It demonstrates:

- Scalable frontend architecture
- Modular CSS systems

- Authentication-aware UI logic
- Production-level metadata (SEO, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Iterative UX refinement

The goal is clarity, usability, and maintainable structure.

## Recent Iterations

02/013/2026 | Portfolio Refactor and UX Enhancements

- Refactored layout architecture for improved scalability
- Modularized archive sections and reusable scroll components
- Enhanced homepage UI spacing, visual hierarchy, and grid systems
- Implemented outside-click detection for mobile navigation (UX polish)
- Improved accessibility with proper aria-expanded handling
- Added production-ready SEO metadata (meta descriptions, structured titles)
- Implemented Open Graph and Twitter Cards with custom 1200×630 preview image
- Strengthened cross-platform presentation (LinkedIn preview support)

This iteration focused on refining the “invisible layers” of the web, structure, metadata, responsiveness, and interaction polish reinforcing my portfolio as a living product rather than a static showcase.
