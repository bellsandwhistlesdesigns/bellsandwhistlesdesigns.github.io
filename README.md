# Bells and Whistles Designs

Official personal portfolio site created by **Douglas Moth**  
Showcasing full-stack web and application development, responsive UI design, and authentication-aware user experiences.

## What This Project Is
This site serves as a living portfolio and technical playground where I design, build, and refine real-world web application features.

The site highlights both **frontend execution** and **backend architecture concepts**, with a focus on clarity, usability, and clean implementation.

## Recent Updates
- Implemented a fully responsive, mobile-first navigation system with a custom hamburger menu

- Refactored global and component-level CSS for better maintainability
- Improved mobile usability and cross-device layout consistency
- Added site-wide favicons for professional browser and bookmark appearance
- Streamlined development workflow using VS Code and GitHub version control
