# Bells and Whistles Designs

Official personal portfolio site created by **Douglas Moth**  
Showcasing full-stack web and application development, responsive UI design, and authentication-aware user experiences.

---

## What This Project Is
This site serves as a living portfolio and technical playground where I design, build, and refine real-world web application features.

The site highlights both **frontend execution** and **backend architecture concepts**, with a focus on clarity, usability, and clean implementation.

---

## Recent Updates
- Implemented a fully responsive, mobile-first navigation system with a custom hamburger menu
- Added authentication-aware UI logic (logout visibility based on user session state)
- Refactored global and component-level CSS for better maintainability
- Improved mobile usability and cross-device layout consistency
- Added site-wide favicons for professional browser and bookmark appearance
- Streamlined development workflow using VS Code and GitHub version control

---

## Quality & Accessibility

This site was audited using Chrome Lighthouse to validate accessibility and
best practices. Core pages scored 100 in accessibility, with dashboard views
maintaining 95+ scores due to intentional design tradeoffs related to color
contrast. Best Practices audits scored 100 across evaluated pages.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

- RESTful API design and integration
- Authentication and session-handling flows
- SQL database design and relational data modeling
- Serverless computing concepts (stateless functions, API-driven logic)
