## What This Project Is

This portfolio was built to demonstrate practical, real-world development skills — not just visual design, but how modern web applications are structured, connected, and maintained.

The site highlights both **frontend execution** and **backend architecture concepts**, with a focus on clarity, usability, and clean implementation.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

- RESTful API design and integration
- Authentication and session-handling flows
- SQL database design and relational data modeling
