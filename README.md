## Quality & Accessibility

This site was audited using Chrome Lighthouse to validate accessibility and
best practices. Core pages scored 100 in accessibility, with dashboard views
maintaining 95+ scores due to intentional design tradeoffs related to color
contrast. Best Practices audits scored 100 across evaluated pages.
