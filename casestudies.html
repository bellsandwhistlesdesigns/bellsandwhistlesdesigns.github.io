        <p>
        Thank you for taking a deeper look into selected engineering challenges from my portfolio:
        <br>
        A focus on problem-solving, architecture, and implementation decisions.

        <h3>Case Study #1: Responsive Navigation & Auth-Aware UI</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
            Navigation worked on desktop but failed on mobile.
            Hamburger menu logic conflicted with auth state.
            Logout visibility needed to adapt dynamically.
            CSS and JS were fighting each other.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong>
            Separated global vs component CSS.
            Refactored header into modular styles.
            Centralized auth logic using localStorage.
            Implemented breakpoint-specific behavior.
            Debugged stacking contexts (z-index issues).</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong>
            Fully responsive navigation across devices.
            Clean, predictable auth-based UI behavior.
            Improved maintainability and clarity.
            Professional UX polish.</p>

         <h3>Case Study #2: Implementing Client-Side Authentication and Session Handling</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
            Needed login/logout behavior without a backend server.
            Pages required conditional UI rendering.
            Session state had to persist across refreshes.</p>   
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong>
            Used localStorage for session persistence.
            Centralized auth checks in dashboard.js.
            Condition-based UI rendering (logout visibility).
            Redirect handling for protected pages.</p>  
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong>
            Functional authentication flow.
            Clear separation of concerns.
            Scalable foundation for backend integration later.</p>

        <h3>Case Study #3: Secure Serverless API Integration</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
        The portfolio required a live RESTful API demo that could fetch and display
        real-time data without exposing sensitive API keys or breaking on static
        hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages. Direct client-side API calls were not
        suitable due to security and deployment limitations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Approach:</strong><br>
        Implemented a serverless backend using Netlify Functions to act as a secure
        proxy between the frontend and a third-party news API. API keys were stored
        as environment variables and never exposed to the client. The frontend was
        designed to consume normalized JSON responses and included environment-aware
        logic to gracefully handle static hosting scenarios.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
        Successfully deployed a production-ready API integration that works reliably
        across desktop and mobile devices. The solution demonstrates secure API
        consumption, serverless architecture, and clean separation of concerns,
        resulting in a scalable, maintainable, and professional-grade demo suitable
        for real-world applications.

        <h3>Case study #4: Does my UI validate against real-world standards?</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
            Ensuring my portfolio was accessible, and usable.
            Is it aligned with modern web best practices?
            Across multiple pages?</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong>
            Ran Lighthouse audits across core pages (Home, Login, Dashboard).
            Evaluated accessibility, contrast, semantic structure, and interaction patterns.
            Addressed issues where appropriate without compromising design consistency.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong>
            Lighthouse Accessibility scores of 100 on public-facing pages.
            Dashboard Accessibility score of 95, with remaining items related to color contrast tradeoffs.
            100 Best Practices score across audited pages.
            Accessibility considerations documented and maintained throughout development.
